# BC-proxy-using-machine-learning
This project was made to predict Black Carbon concentration in Delhi. 
The scripts were not written to be reused, but only for a personal use, which explains why there is not a proper documentation, and very few comments.  
Iva is the main author of the LSTM.py script, Pau did a consequent part of the classes.py script, and I did the rest. Please, find below their respective Github profile:

The data is not published to respect privacy. They contain measures of Black Carbon concentration on the year 2018 and 2019, with features BC, date, Hours, PM10, PM2.5, RH, NOX, Ozone.  

* src folder contains all the scripts
* scores folder contains scores from RF and SVR cross validation
* img folder contains images of seasons spliting, correlation matrix of the features, and error in LSTM. 
* data folder is empty. It originally contained the data file.
